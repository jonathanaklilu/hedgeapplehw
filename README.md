I created this project using Jupyter notebook, Google Colab. When I first started the project, I imported pandas and created a dataframe using the csv file that was imported in as well. I wanted to have a visual idea on what the dataframe looked like. Next, I wanted to know all the columns that I wanted to return at the end of the project. When I began to figure this out, I thought that the example homework and the file I wanted to output were the same. I later found out this wasn't true by looking up one of the sku numbers in the homework.csv. So using the sku number 3129-1149, I found an item number that matched up. I used the row that contained that item number as a reference for the rest of the project. Looking through the example.csv and homework.csv dataframe, I chose columns that I thought best fit what was neeeded to know. I created a new dataframe with all the chosen columns. I then formatted the columns into names that were readable. Lastly, I return the dataframe as a csv file called formatted.csv.
